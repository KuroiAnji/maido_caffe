The zip file of the workspace of a mod I'm working on, made whit MCreator 2021.3, actually in alpha.

Known Bugs & Warnings!
 The mod is an Alpha, it is not stable and may cause minecraft crush in certain circumstances,
 so be careful and make a back-up of your world if you want to add it in an existing world,
 but I suggest you to make a new world that you can delete after to test it;
 
 Making a damage equal to 1000 or higher to the maid will probably cause crush
 or some function to not working properly;
 
 It was made to be compatible whit other mods and multiplayer,
 but maybe not enought optimized despite my will to do so;
 
 In multiplayer destroying other's Way Points block will affect Your Active Way Points
 and reset Your Way Points in the list, at the same way won't decrease owner Active Way Points Amount.
 The block is not made to be normally destructed by explosions;
 
 Some times the maid gui will display the main button only when the maid is already set to main,
 you should close the gui and re-open it, some times you should make this action more than one time;
